##There is some general ideas to use this distributed version controller   **Github**





  - Now we have 2 parallel branches, named `master` and `develop`. As its name reveals, `master` is the main branch, which is updated only to have a better AI (**Without a bug**)

> - `develop` is exactly the branch we can develop on. 

> - Everytime we want to **modify something**, or just do some debuging, **Create** a new branch from `develop`, then do the things you want on the new branch **Which is on your own PC**.(You needn't publish the new branch to online github repository) 

> - Once you finish(**you may have tested the new AI**), and you think it is better than the previous one, Make a `Pull Request` from this new branch to `develop`, and we can have a discussion about it, then commit the merge.(to allow the changes also emerge in branch `develop`)

>- Once the `Pull Request` is committed, then you can delete your own branch(the one you create just now).
